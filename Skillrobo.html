🧠 Most hiring mistakes begin with over trusting resumes.
Better hiring doesn’t come from one tool, it comes from the right stack.
Here’s a common structure modern teams follow 👇

👉 Skills and aptitude  

   Skillrobo - Pre-Employment Assessment Tools 

👉 Interviews and evaluation  

   HireVue - Video Interviewing and Structured Candidate Evaluation 

👉 Verification and compliance 
 
   Checkr - Background Verification and Compliance Checks 

👉 Onboarding and HR ops  

   BambooHR - HR Management and Employee Onboarding 

👉 Learning and growth  

   LinkedIn Learning - Employee Learning and Skill Development 

Hiring isn’t a single step.
It’s a system.
